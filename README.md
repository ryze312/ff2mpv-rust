# ff2mpv-rust

</div>

Native messaging host for ff2mpv written in Rust.

This is a native compiled binary, so it runs much faster and doesn't require external dependencies by itself, unlike Python and Ruby scripts.

# What is this?
This is a script for hooking mpv and [ff2mpv](https://github.com/woodruffw/ff2mpv), that allows opening any video link in mpv straight from the browser.

# Installation
First, install ff2mpv extension from [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ff2mpv) or [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ff2mpv/ephjcajbkgplkjmelpglennepbpmdpjg).

After that get native messasing host manifest:
```
ff2mpv-rust manifest
```
Or for Chromium/Chrome:
```
ff2mpv-rust manifest_chromium
```

Install it following manual installation instructions on [ff2mpv wiki](https://github.com/woodruffw/ff2mpv/wiki).

# Configuration
On Linux configuration file is searched in such order:

1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ff2mpv-rust.json
2. $HOME/.config/ff2mpv-rust.json
3. /etc/ff2mpv-rust.json

On Windows configuration file should be placed at: %APPDATA%/ff2mpv-rust.json.

See [default configuration](ff2mpv-rust.json).
Note that default configuration passes `--` as last argument in order to prevent argument injection.
When editing you should either keep it or use a similar argument for the player you want to use.

# Command line interface
ff2mpv-rust provides command line interface with following commands:
```
help: prints help message
manifest: prints manifest for Firefox configuration
manifest_chromium: prints manifest for Chromium/Chrome configuration
validate: checks configration file for validity
```
Note that it won't fail on invalid commands, but instead assume it is called from browser, blocking the input.
